# PTG Trading Strategy Project

## üéØ Project Overview

**PTG (Push-Test-Go)** is an automated trading strategy for **Gold (XAUUSD) M1** that identifies high-probability breakout opportunities through volume and price action analysis.

### Core Concept
- **PUSH**: Detect strong momentum candle with high volume and range
- **TEST**: Wait for pullback/consolidation 
- **GO**: Execute breakout trade when price breaks test range

---

## üö® Critical Problem Solved

### The "Every Tick" vs "Real Tick" Issue
**Problem**: EA worked perfectly in "Every tick" mode but failed in "Every tick based on real ticks"

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Spread Handling**: Real tick has dynamic spreads (8-15 pips) vs synthetic constant spread
2. **Order Execution**: STOP-LIMIT orders failed due to minimum distance requirements  
3. **Position Management**: Breakeven/Trail too aggressive for real spread fluctuations
4. **Risk Management**: ATR-based SL too wide (100-400 pips) for Gold real volatility
5. **Entry Confirmation**: Confirmation logic too strict for real tick noise

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed spread filter (MaxSpreadPips = 12)
- Switched to Market Orders from STOP-LIMIT
- Implemented spread-buffered breakeven
- Fixed SL distance (25 pips) instead of swing-based
- Disabled strict confirmation logic

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications

### PTG Signal Detection Logic
```mq5
// PUSH Criteria
bool range_criteria = current_range >= avg_range * 0.35;  // 35% above average
bool volume_criteria = volume >= avg_volume * 1.2;        // 120% volume spike  
bool momentum_criteria = close_position >= 0.45;          // Close in top 45%
bool wick_criteria = opposite_wick <= 0.55;               // Opposite wick ‚â§55%

// TEST Criteria  
bool pullback_max = pullback <= 0.85;                     // Max 85% retracement
bool low_volume = test_volume <= avg_volume * 2.0;        // Lower volume on test
bool timeout = bars_since_push <= 10;                     // Within 10 bars

// GO Execution
// Market order with 25 pip fixed SL when breakout confirmed
```

### Risk Management (ChatGPT Optimized)
```mq5
// Fixed Risk Parameters
FixedSLPips = 25.0;                    // Fixed SL distance
MaxRiskPips = 35.0;                    // Max risk per trade
BreakevenPips = 15.0;                  // Move to BE at +15 pips
PartialTPPips = 22.0;                  // Take 30% profit at +22 pips  
TrailStepPips = 18.0;                  // Trail every 18 pips
MaxSpreadPips = 12.0;                  // Skip trades when spread > 12 pips
```

### Gold-Specific Adaptations
```mq5
// Proper Gold pip calculation
double Pip() {
    if(StringFind(Symbol(), "XAU") >= 0) return 0.01;  // Gold = 0.01
    // ... other symbols
}

// Spread-buffered breakeven for real tick
double be_price = original_entry + spread + 0.5_pip;  // Prevent spread spike triggers

// Dynamic entry buffer based on current spread
double buffer = MathMax(1.5, current_spread * 1.2);
```

- **Target**: 35%+ win rate  
- **Approach**: Analyze false signals, add filters

### Priority 2: Entry Timing Optimization
- **Current**: Immediate market entry
- **Consider**: Delayed confirmation, momentum filters

### Priority 3: Dynamic Risk Management
- **Current**: Fixed 25p SL
- **Consider**: Volatility-adjusted SL, correlation filters

### Priority 4: Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- **Current**: M1 only
- **Consider**: M5/M15 trend confirmation

## üìö Key Learnings

### Real Tick vs Synthetic Tick Differences
1. **Spread Behavior**: Real tick has dynamic, volatile spreads
2. **Order Execution**: Real tick has minimum distance requirements
3. **Price Movement**: Real tick has more noise and microstructure effects
4. **Position Management**: BE/Trail need wider buffers for real conditions

### Professional Insights (from ChatGPT Analysis)
1. Use STOP-LIMIT orders with proper distance calculation
2. Implement spread-buffered breakeven to prevent false triggers  
3. Dynamic entry buffers based on current market conditions
4. Fixed SL distances work better than swing-based for Gold
5. Order expiration through server (ORDER_TIME_SPECIFIED) vs manual cleanup
