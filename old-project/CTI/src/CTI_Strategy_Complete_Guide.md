# 🚀 CTI Strategy Complete - Full ICT Implementation

## 🎯 Tổng Quan Strategy

**CTI Strategy Complete** là implementation hoàn chỉnh của ICT (Inner Circle Trader) strategy với logic:

```
CHoCH → FVG Detection → Retest → LTF Entry → OB Fallback
```

### 📊 Strategy Flow:

1. **Detect CHoCH** - Change of Character (trend change signal)
2. **Find FVG** on the swing that created CHoCH (manipulation confirmation)  
3. **Wait for Retest** back to FVG zone
4. **Generate Entry** when retest occurs
5. **OB Fallback** if price pushes through FVG (backup plan)
6. **Statistics Logging** for performance tracking

## 🔧 Features Implemented:

### ✅ 1. Đường Ngang Ngắn (Short Horizontal Lines)
```cpp
CreateShortHorizontalLine() - Vẽ đường level tại mỗi swing point
- Độ dài: 10 bars
- Style: Dashed line  
- Color: Configurable
```

### ✅ 2. FVG Detection on CHoCH Swings
```cpp
DetectFVGOnCHoCH() - Tìm FVG trên con sóng tạo CHoCH
- Bullish FVG: low[i+1] > high[i-1] 
- Bearish FVG: high[i+1] < low[i-1]
- Min Size: Configurable (default 5 points)
- Visual: Rectangle zones với labels
```

### ✅ 3. Retest Logic & Entry Signals  
```cpp
CheckRetestsAndEntries() - Đợi retest về FVG
- Monitor price entering FVG zone
- Generate LONG/SHORT entry signals
- Visual: "LONG ↑" / "SHORT ↓" labels
- Colors: Green (Long) / Red (Short)
```

### ✅ 4. Order Block Fallback
```cpp
DetectOBAtCHoCH() - Tìm OB nếu FVG thất bại
- OB at CHoCH swing points
- Bullish OB: Bearish candle near swing low
- Bearish OB: Bullish candle near swing high  
- Backup entry when FVG is invalidated
```

### ✅ 5. Statistics & Logging System
```cpp
InitializeLogging() - CSV file logging
- File: CTI_Stats.csv (in Common folder)
- Tracks: Time, Type, Price, Direction, Result
- Real-time stats display on chart
- Success rate calculation
```

## 📈 Visual Elements:

### Chart Display:
```
🔹 CHoCH Labels: "CHoCH↑" (Cyan) / "CHoCH↓" (Yellow)
🔹 FVG Zones: Light Blue rectangles with "FVG" labels
🔹 OB Zones: Light Gray rectangles with "OB" labels  
🔹 Swing Lines: Short dashed horizontal lines
🔹 Entry Signals: "LONG ↑" (Green) / "SHORT ↓" (Red)
🔹 Statistics: Top-left corner performance display
```

## ⚙️ Configuration:

### Input Parameters:
```cpp
// Swing Detection
SwingLookback = 5              // Fractal lookback
RequireCloseBreak = true       // BOS close requirement
BreakBuffer = 2.0              // Buffer points

// Strategy Settings  
ShowFVGZones = true            // Display FVG zones
ShowOBZones = true             // Display OB zones
ShowRetestLines = true         // Show horizontal lines
ShowEntrySignals = true        // Show entry signals
FVGMinSize = 5.0              // Min FVG size (points)
RetestTimeout = 20            // Bars to wait for retest
EntryTimeout = 15             // Entry confirmation timeout

// Logging
EnableLogging = true          // Enable CSV logging
LogFileName = "CTI_Stats.csv" // Log file name
```

## 🎮 Usage Instructions:

### 1. Installation:
```
1. Copy CTI_Strategy_Complete.mq5 to MQL5/Indicators/
2. Compile in MetaEditor  
3. Attach to chart
4. Configure parameters as needed
```

### 2. Strategy Execution:

#### Phase 1: CHoCH Detection
```
👀 Monitor for HL (bullish CHoCH) or LH (bearish CHoCH)
✅ CHoCH Label appears: "CHoCH↑" or "CHoCH↓"
```

#### Phase 2: FVG Confirmation  
```
🔍 Look for FVG zone on the swing that created CHoCH
📊 Blue rectangle appears = FVG detected
💡 This confirms market manipulation
```

#### Phase 3: Retest & Entry
```
⏳ Wait for price to return to FVG zone
🎯 Entry signal generates: "LONG ↑" or "SHORT ↓"  
📝 Signal logged to CSV file automatically
```

#### Phase 4: OB Fallback (if needed)
```
❌ If price pushes through FVG (invalidated)
🔍 Look for OB zone at CHoCH swing point
📊 Gray rectangle = OB zone detected
🎯 New entry opportunity at OB retest
```

### 3. Reading the Signals:

#### Bullish Setup Example:
```
1. CHoCH↑ appears (HL formation)
2. Blue FVG zone shows above CHoCH swing
3. Price retests FVG zone  
4. "LONG ↑" signal appears → Enter long
5. If FVG fails → Watch for OB zone retest
```

#### Bearish Setup Example:
```
1. CHoCH↓ appears (LH formation)  
2. Blue FVG zone shows below CHoCH swing
3. Price retests FVG zone
4. "SHORT ↓" signal appears → Enter short
5. If FVG fails → Watch for OB zone retest
```

## 🚨 Trading Rules:

### Entry Criteria:
```
✅ CHoCH confirmed (HL for bull, LH for bear)
✅ FVG detected on CHoCH swing  
✅ Price retests FVG zone
✅ Entry signal generated
```

### Risk Management:
```
🛡️ Stop Loss: Below/above CHoCH swing
🎯 Take Profit: Next swing level
📏 Position Size: Based on ATR or fixed %
```

### Invalidation:
```
❌ Price closes beyond FVG without retest
❌ New opposing CHoCH forms
❌ Entry timeout exceeded
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### No Signals Appearing:
```
1. Check SwingLookback setting (try 3-7)
2. Verify FVGMinSize not too large
3. Ensure ShowEntrySignals = true
4. Check timeframe compatibility
```

### Too Many Signals:
```
1. Increase FVGMinSize filter
2. Increase SwingLookback for fewer swings
3. Enable RequireCloseBreak = true
4. Adjust BreakBuffer for noise filtering
```

### Logging Issues:
```
1. Check EnableLogging = true
2. Verify file permissions
3. Look in MT5_Data/MQL5/Files/Common/
4. Restart MT5 if file locked
```
