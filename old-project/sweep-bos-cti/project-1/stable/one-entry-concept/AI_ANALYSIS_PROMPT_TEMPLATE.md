## üìã CONTEXT SETTING PROMPT

```
You are an expert algorithmic trading analyst specializing in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) Expert Advisors (EAs) for Gold (XAUUSD) trading on M1 timeframe. I need your analysis of a Push-Test-Go (PTG) trading strategy that has been systematically developed and tested.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Symbol: XAUUSD (Gold)
- Timeframe: M1 (1-minute charts)
- Platform: MetaTrader 5 with "Every tick based on real ticks" backtesting
- Strategy: PTG (Push-Test-Go) - detect momentum, validate, execute
- Current Status: PTG FINAL ULTIMATE v3.5.0 achieved 67.87% ROI with only 3 trades
- Key Insight: Quality over quantity - fewer, higher-quality trades outperform high-frequency approaches

PROVEN FACTS FROM SYSTEMATIC TESTING:
1. TestCase 6 (Very Strong): 2 trades, 50% win rate, +3,396 USD, max 1 consecutive loss = CHAMPION
2. ChatGPT 3.6.0 approach: 3,061 trades, 1.92% win rate, -2,432 USD = DISASTER
3. High-frequency approaches consistently fail (1-13% win rates)
4. Ultra-selective criteria ensure survivability and profitability
5. Big winner strategy: Allow occasional small losses for massive wins

CURRENT CHAMPION PARAMETERS (TestCase 6):
- PushRangePercent: 0.36 (ultra-strict)
- ClosePercent: 0.46 (very strict) 
- VolHighMultiplier: 1.22 (high volume requirement)
- MaxSpreadPips: 13.0 (tight filter)
- SessionFilter: 8-16 GMT (peak hours only)
- MomentumThresholdPips: 8.0 (high momentum)
- FixedSLPips: 21.0 (tight stop loss)
- Circuit Breaker: 6 losses ‚Üí 55min cooldown

YOUR ANALYSIS SHOULD:
- Respect the proven "quality over quantity" principle
- Acknowledge that complexity destroys performance
- Focus on survivability (max consecutive losses) as key metric
- Consider Gold-specific characteristics (pip = 0.01, high volatility)
- Understand that fewer trades with higher win rates are superior

## üîç SPECIFIC ANALYSIS PROMPTS

### 1. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS PROMPT
```
Analyze the following backtest results for PTG FINAL ULTIMATE v3.5.0:

[PASTE BACKTEST RESULTS HERE]

Please provide analysis on:
1. Trade quality assessment (frequency vs profitability)
2. Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio, profit factor)
3. Survivability metrics (consecutive losses, drawdown)
4. Comparison with industry standards
5. Strengths and potential weaknesses
6. Recommendations for live trading deployment

Focus on the "quality over quantity" principle and explain why 3 trades with 67.87% ROI is superior to 3,061 trades with -48.64% loss.
```

### 2. PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION PROMPT
```
Given the champion TestCase 6 parameters that achieved 2 trades, 50% win rate, +3,396 USD:

Current Parameters:
- PushRangePercent: 0.36
- ClosePercent: 0.46  
- VolHighMultiplier: 1.22
- MaxSpreadPips: 13.0
- MomentumThresholdPips: 8.0

Historical Context:
- 14 different configurations tested systematically
- High-frequency approaches (72-3,061 trades) consistently failed
- Ultra-selective approaches (2-3 trades) succeeded

Question: Should any parameters be adjusted for live trading, or should we maintain the exact champion configuration?

Consider:
1. Market condition changes
2. Broker-specific factors (spreads, execution)
3. Capital scaling requirements
4. Risk tolerance adjustments

Remember: Over-optimization destroyed previous versions. Simplicity and proven results should be prioritized.
```

### 3. RISK MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS PROMPT
```
Evaluate the risk management system of PTG FINAL ULTIMATE v3.5.0:

Current Risk Management:
- Stop Loss: 21 pips (tight protection)
- Breakeven: 26 pips (early protection) 
- Trailing: Start 43 pips, step 21 pips
- Circuit Breaker: 6 losses ‚Üí 55min cooldown
- Position Size: 0.10 lots fixed
- Max Consecutive Losses: 0 (actual), 1 (historical max)

Results Context:
- 3 trades: 2 small losses (-21p each), 1 massive win (+35,879p)
- Perfect survivability with 0 consecutive losses at completion
- 67.87% ROI with 0.09% maximum drawdown

Analyze:
1. Risk-reward ratio effectiveness
2. Position sizing appropriateness 
3. Circuit breaker necessity and calibration
4. Trailing stop strategy optimization
5. Capital preservation vs profit maximization balance

Provide recommendations while respecting the proven "big winner" approach.
```

### 4. MARKET CONDITION ADAPTATION PROMPT
```
The PTG system was developed and tested during Aug 21 - Sep 10, 2025 period. 

Market Characteristics During Testing:
- Gold volatility: Variable (ATR-based filtering used)
- Spread conditions: 11.2p average (13p max filter)
- Session focus: 8-16 GMT (London/NY overlap)
- Economic events: [SPECIFY IF KNOWN]

Questions for Analysis:
1. How might different market conditions affect performance?
2. Should parameters adapt to changing volatility regimes?
3. Are there seasonal or economic calendar considerations?
4. How to maintain the "ultra-selective" approach across market cycles?
5. What monitoring indicators suggest parameter adjustment needs?

Remember: The system succeeded by being highly selective (3 trades total). Any adaptations should maintain this core principle.
```

### 5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS PROMPT
```
Compare and contrast these approaches that were systematically tested:

1. PTG FINAL ULTIMATE v3.5.0: 3 trades, 33.33% win rate, +67.87% ROI

3. TestCase 1 (Default): 72 trades, 1.39% win rate, +55.54% ROI
4. TestCase 2 (Softer): 204 trades, 0.49% win rate, +44.38% ROI

Analysis Required:
1. Why does trade frequency inversely correlate with performance?
2. What causes the dramatic win rate differences?
3. How does complexity impact trading results?
4. What lessons apply to algorithmic trading in general?
5. Are there any scenarios where high-frequency might be better?

Provide insights that could guide future algorithmic trading development across different strategies and markets.

### 8. TROUBLESHOOTING PROMPT
```
Help diagnose issues with PTG FINAL ULTIMATE v3.5.0 deployment:

Issue Description: [DESCRIBE SPECIFIC PROBLEM]

System Context:
- Expected: 1-2 trades per month maximum
- Expected Win Rate: 30-50%
- Expected: 2 small losses for every 1 big winner
- Normal: Extended periods without trades due to ultra-selective criteria

Common Issues:
1. No trades executing (spread filter, session filter, circuit breaker)
2. Frequent small losses (normal pattern, big winner compensates)
3. Extended periods without signals (expected with ultra-selective approach)

Provide systematic troubleshooting steps while considering that the system is designed for very low frequency, high-quality trades.
