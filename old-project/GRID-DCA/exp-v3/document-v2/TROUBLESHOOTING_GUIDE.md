### **❌ EA Starts But No Grid Setup**

#### **Issue: Insufficient Price History**
```
Symptoms:
├─ EA initializes successfully
├─ Log: "ATR calculation failed" or "array out of range"
├─ No grid setup occurs
└─ Base price shows 0.0

Solution:
1. Wait for sufficient price history (minimum 50 H1 bars)
2. Check symbol's historical data availability
3. Request history: Tools → History Center
4. Download H1 data for selected symbol
5. Restart EA after data is available

Verification:
├─ Check H1 chart shows historical data
├─ Verify ATR indicator works on H1 chart
├─ Confirm at least 50 bars available
└─ Monitor log for successful ATR calculation

Prevention:
├─ Always test on symbols with good data
├─ Allow time for data synchronization
├─ Use major pairs for reliable data
└─ Check data quality before live trading
```

#### **Issue: Trend Filter Blocking Setup**
```
Symptoms:
├─ EA initializes successfully
├─ Log: "TREND FILTER: Waiting for sideways market"
├─ No grid setup for extended periods
└─ Strong trend conditions present

Solution:
1. Check current market conditions:
   - View EMA(8,13,21) on H1 chart
   - Check ADX indicator on H1 chart
   - Verify if strong trend is present

2. Temporary solution (testing):
   - Set InpUseTrendFilter = false
   - Monitor performance without filter
   - Re-enable after testing

3. Adjust filter sensitivity:
   - Increase InpMaxADXStrength (25 → 30)
   - Test with more permissive settings
   - Monitor win rate changes

Prevention:
├─ Understand market conditions before enabling
├─ Start with filter disabled for learning
├─ Optimize ADX threshold for symbol
└─ Monitor trend filter effectiveness daily
```

#### **Issue: Spread Too High**
```
Symptoms:
├─ EA initializes successfully
├─ Log: "Spread too high: X pips > Y pips"
├─ No grid setup during high spread periods
└─ Trading blocked during news events

Solution:
1. Check current spread:
   - Market Watch → Symbol → Spread
   - Compare to normal range for symbol
   - Wait for spread normalization

2. Adjust spread settings:
   - Set InpMaxSpreadPips = 0.0 (auto-adaptive)
   - Verify adaptive spread limits appropriate
   - Consider increasing if consistently blocked

3. For specific symbols:
   - Gold: Spread can be 15-150 pips (normal)
   - Major Forex: 1-10 pips (normal)
   - Minor pairs: 3-25 pips (normal)

Prevention:
├─ Use adaptive spread limits (0.0 setting)
├─ Monitor spread patterns by session
├─ Avoid trading around major news
└─ Choose symbols with reasonable spreads
```

#### **Issue: Grid Levels Too Far from Market**
```
Symptoms:
├─ Orders placed successfully
├─ Price doesn't reach grid levels
├─ Long periods without fills
└─ Grid levels appear too wide

Solution:
1. Analyze current grid spacing:
   - Check ATR values for symbol

   - Verify InpATRMultiplier setting

2. Adjust grid spacing:
   - Reduce InpATRMultiplier (1.0 → 0.8)
   - Test on demo account first
   - Monitor fill frequency changes

3. Consider market conditions:
   - Low volatility periods
   - Trending vs ranging markets
   - Symbol-specific characteristics

Prevention:
├─ Optimize ATR multiplier for each symbol
├─ Monitor fill frequency daily
├─ Adjust for market conditions
└─ Use Strategy Tester for optimization
```

#### **Issue: Fibonacci Spacing Issues**
```
Symptoms:
├─ InpUseFibonacciSpacing = true
├─ Very wide grid spacing
├─ Infrequent order fills
└─ Grid levels seem inappropriate

Solution:
1. Understand Fibonacci spacing:
   - Level 1: 0.618 × base spacing
   - Level 2: 1.000 × base spacing
   - Level 3: 1.618 × base spacing
   - Level 4: 2.618 × base spacing
   - Level 5: 4.236 × base spacing

2. Adjust for Fibonacci:
   - Reduce InpATRMultiplier (1.0 → 0.6-0.8)
   - Test with fewer grid levels initially
   - Monitor level fill patterns

3. Alternative approach:
   - Disable Fibonacci: InpUseFibonacciSpacing = false
   - Use equal spacing initially
   - Enable after understanding behavior

Prevention:
├─ Start with Fibonacci disabled
├─ Understand spacing implications
├─ Test thoroughly before live use
└─ Optimize multiplier for Fibonacci mode

├─ Trend filter defaults to allow trading
├─ No EMA/ADX analysis in logs
└─ Filter appears non-functional

Solution:
1. Check indicator setup:
   - Verify sufficient H1 price history
   - Check indicator handle creation
   - Monitor initialization process

2. Data requirements:
   - Minimum 50 H1 bars needed
   - Stable broker connection required
   - Symbol data must be available

   - Monitor expansion detection

2. Trigger verification:
   - Ensure DCA expansion actually occurred
   - Check floor(levels/2) calculation
   - Verify expansion order placement

3. Mode activation:
   - Look for "DCA RECOVERY MODE ACTIVATED" message
   - Check profit target adjustments
   - Monitor recovery behavior

Prevention:
├─ Test DCA recovery on demo thoroughly
├─ Monitor recovery mode activation
├─ Document recovery trigger conditions
└─ Verify recovery target calculations
```

#### **Issue: Recovery Targets Too Low**
```
Symptoms:
├─ Recovery mode activates correctly
├─ Targets set to break-even or very low
├─ Positions closed at minimal profit
└─ Frequent recovery cycles

Solution:
1. Analyze recovery calculation:
   - Target = MathMax(0.0, -InpMaxLossUSD / 2.0)
   - Example: $10 loss limit → $0 recovery target
   - Consider if this is appropriate

2. Adjust loss limit:
   - Increase InpMaxLossUSD for higher recovery targets
   - Example: $20 loss limit → $10 recovery target
   - Balance protection vs profitability

3. Manual override consideration:
   - Consider custom recovery target logic
   - Test different recovery calculations
   - Optimize for your risk tolerance

Prevention:
├─ Test recovery targets before live use
├─ Monitor recovery profitability
├─ Adjust loss limits based on performance

2. Symbol name variations:
   - XAUUSD vs GOLD vs XAU/USD
   - BTCUSD vs BTC/USD vs BITCOIN
   - Check broker's exact naming

3. Alternative approaches:
   - Use SYMBOL_CURRENT instead
   - Select from available symbols only
   - Contact broker for symbol availability

Prevention:
├─ Verify symbol names before configuration
├─ Test symbol availability on demo
├─ Use SYMBOL_CURRENT as safe default
└─ Document broker's symbol names
```

#### **Issue: Inappropriate Parameters for Symbol**
```
Symptoms:

├─ Symbol type not detected correctly
└─ Inappropriate spread limits applied

Solution:
1. Check symbol classification:
   - Verify symbol type detection
   - Check adaptive spread calculation
   - Monitor spread limit application

2. Manual override:
   - Set specific spread limit instead of 0.0
   - Test with symbol-appropriate values
   - Monitor effectiveness

3. Debug spread detection:
   - Check log messages for spread calculations
   - Verify symbol string matching
   - Test with known symbol types

Prevention:
