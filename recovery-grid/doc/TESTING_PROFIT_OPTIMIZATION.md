## 🎯 Test Configurations

### 1. Baseline Test (Current System)
**Purpose**: Establish performance baseline

```properties
# Multi-Job Settings
InpMultiJobEnabled = true
InpMaxJobs = 3
InpSpawnCooldownSec = 60

# DISABLE all optimizations
InpSmartCloseEnabled = false
InpRangeDetectEnabled = false
InpProfitAccelEnabled = false

# Standard settings
InpGridLevels = 10
InpLotBase = 0.01
InpTargetCycleUSD = 5.0
```

**Expected Results**:
- Profit Factor: ~0.66
- Average Win: ~$8
- Average Loss: ~$25
- Win Rate: ~83%

**Record**: Screenshot results for comparison

### 2. Smart Close Only Test
**Purpose**: Test impact of not closing losing jobs

```properties
# Enable Smart Close
InpSmartCloseEnabled = true
InpMinProfitToClose = 1.0

# Keep others disabled
InpRangeDetectEnabled = false
InpProfitAccelEnabled = false
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- Profit Factor: 1.0-1.2
- Average Loss: Reduced to ~$15
- Fewer premature closures

**What to Watch**:
- Jobs staying open when losing
- Helper jobs spawning correctly
- No job collisions

### 3. Job TP & Trailing Test
**Purpose**: Test profit targets and trailing

```properties
# Smart Close + Job TP
InpSmartCloseEnabled = true
InpJobTPUSD = 10.0
InpJobTrailStartUSD = 5.0
InpJobTrailStepUSD = 2.0
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- Profit Factor: 1.2-1.5
- Average Win: Increased to ~$10
- More consistent profits

**What to Watch**:
- Jobs closing at TP
- Trailing activation at $5
- Trail stop movements

### 4. Range Detection Test
**Purpose**: Test market adaptation

```properties
# Enable Range Detection
InpRangeDetectEnabled = true
InpRangeATRPeriod = 14
InpRangeThreshold = 0.5
InpRangeTightSpacing = 0.5
InpRangeLotMultiplier = 2.0
InpRangeTPMultiplier = 0.3
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- Profit Factor: 1.5-1.8
- Quick profits in ranging markets
- Better risk management in trends

**What to Watch**:
- Market condition detection logs
- Grid spacing changes per job
- Lot size adaptations
- TP adjustments

### 5. Profit Acceleration Test
**Purpose**: Test booster positions

```properties
# Enable Acceleration
InpProfitAccelEnabled = true
InpBoosterThreshold = 5.0
InpBoosterLotMultiplier = 2.0
InpMaxBoosters = 3
```

**Expected Improvement**:
- Profit Factor: 1.8-2.2
- Average Win: $15-20
- Winners compound quickly

**What to Watch**:
- Booster deployment at $5 profit
- Maximum 3 boosters per job
- TP tightening to 70%
- 60-second cooldown

### 6. Full System Test
**Purpose**: All features enabled

```properties
# Everything ON
InpSmartCloseEnabled = true
InpMinProfitToClose = 1.0
InpJobTPUSD = 10.0
InpJobTrailStartUSD = 5.0
InpJobTrailStepUSD = 2.0
InpRangeDetectEnabled = true
InpProfitAccelEnabled = true
InpBoosterThreshold = 5.0
```

**Target Results**:
- **Profit Factor: 2.0+** ✅
- Average Win: $20+
- Average Loss: <$15
- Win Rate: 85%+
- Recovery Factor: 3.0+
- Max DD: <20%

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track

### Primary Metrics
1. **Profit Factor** - Target: >2.0
2. **Average Win/Loss Ratio** - Target: >1.5
3. **Recovery Factor** - Target: >3.0
4. **Win Rate** - Target: >85%
5. **Max Drawdown** - Target: <20%

### Secondary Metrics
- Total trades
- Consecutive wins/losses
- Average trade duration
- Jobs spawned per day
- Boosters deployed

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Good Signs ✅
- Jobs closing only when profitable
- Quick profits in ranging markets
- Boosters deploying on winners
- Trailing stops protecting profits
- Adaptive grid spacing

### Warning Signs ⚠️
- Jobs accumulating huge losses
- Too many concurrent jobs
- Booster positions not closing
- Range detection false positives
- Memory/CPU issues

### Red Flags 🚩
- Profit Factor still <1.0
- Max DD >30%
- Jobs hitting SL frequently
- System freezing/crashing
- Infinite spawn loops

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Smart Close Not Working
**Symptoms**: Jobs still closing at grid full when losing
**Check**:
- `InpSmartCloseEnabled = true`
- `InpMinProfitToClose` set correctly
- Look for `[SMART]` tags in logs

### Issue: Range Detection Wrong
**Symptoms**: Ranging market detected in strong trend
**Check**:
- `InpRangeATRPeriod` (try 20-30)
- `InpRangeThreshold` (try 0.3-0.7)
- Check M15 timeframe data available

### Issue: Boosters Not Deploying
**Symptoms**: Job profitable but no boosters
**Check**:
- `InpProfitAccelEnabled = true`
- Job profit >= `InpBoosterThreshold`
- Not at max boosters yet
- 60-second cooldown passed

### Issue: Performance Worse
**Symptoms**: PF decreased with optimizations
**Check**:
- Start with one feature at a time
- Reduce lot multipliers
- Increase profit thresholds
- Check for parameter conflicts

## 📈 Optimization Tips

### For Ranging Markets
- Decrease `InpRangeTightSpacing` to 0.3
- Increase `InpRangeLotMultiplier` to 3.0
- Set `InpRangeTPMultiplier` to 0.2 (very quick)

### For Trending Markets
- Increase `InpBoosterThreshold` to 10.0
- Decrease `InpMaxBoosters` to 2
- Increase `InpJobTPUSD` to 15.0

### For High Volatility
- Increase `InpSpawnCooldownSec` to 120
- Decrease `InpMaxJobs` to 2
- Increase `InpMinProfitToClose` to 2.0
