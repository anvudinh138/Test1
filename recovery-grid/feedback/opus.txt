Looking at your test results and the multi-job system
  implementation, I can see the core issue: the system is too 
  defensive - it's protecting capital well but not maximizing
  profit opportunities. Here's my analysis and bold suggestions:

  📊 Current Performance Analysis

  From your screenshots:
  - Profit Factor: 0.66 (losing)
  - Recovery Factor: -0.91 (poor)
  - Win Rate: 83% (good)
  - Average Win: $8 vs Average Loss**: $25 (3:1 negative ratio)
  - Max Consecutive Wins: 77 (excellent)
  - Max Consecutive Losses: Only 2 (very good)

  Problem: High win rate but losses are 3x larger than wins!

  🔍 Root Causes

  1. Grid Full = Close logic is too conservative
    - Closing at grid full means accepting whatever P&L exists
    - Often closing at max drawdown point
  2. No Profit Optimization
    - System focuses on risk (Job SL) but not on profit capture
    - Missing opportunities when price reverses favorably
  3. Single Direction Bias
    - Each job trades both directions but doesn't exploit ranging
   markets

  🚀 Bold Ideas to Increase Profit

  1. Smart Close Logic (Don't Close at Grid Full)

  // Instead of closing when grid full, check profit potential
  bool ShouldCloseJob(int job_index) {
      // Option A: Close only if profitable
      if (m_jobs[job_index].unrealized_pnl > InpMinProfitToClose)
   {
          return true; // Take profit
      }

      // Option B: Close if deep loss (SL)
      if (m_jobs[job_index].unrealized_pnl <=
  -m_jobs[job_index].job_sl_usd) {
          return true; // Stop loss
      }

      // Option C: Keep running if between profit/loss
      return false; // Let it recover!
  }

  2. Profit Acceleration Mode

  When a job is winning, double down:

  // When job is profitable, add "booster" positions
  if (job.unrealized_pnl > InpBoosterThreshold) {
      // Add extra positions in winning direction
      AddBoosterPositions(job, winning_direction);
  }

  3. Range Harvesting Strategy

  Since you have 77 consecutive wins, the market is ranging:

  // Detect range and milk it
  if (DetectRangeMode()) {
      // Tighten grid spacing
      m_spacing_multiplier = 0.5; // Half spacing

      // Increase lot size
      m_lot_multiplier = 2.0; // Double lots

      // Set tight TP
      m_target_cycle_usd = 2.0; // Quick profits
  }

  4. Asymmetric Grid Deployment

  Deploy more levels on the winning side:

  // If BUY is winning, add more BUY levels
  if (buy_pnl > sell_pnl) {
      m_buy_grid_levels = InpGridLevels * 1.5;  // 150% levels
      m_sell_grid_levels = InpGridLevels * 0.5; // 50% levels
  }

  5. Martingale Profit Lock

  When profitable, use martingale to lock it:

  // Job profitable? Spawn child with 2x lot
  if (job.unrealized_pnl > InpProfitLockThreshold) {
      SpawnChildJob(job.job_id, lot_multiplier: 2.0);
      // Child job protects parent's profit
  }

  💡 Recommended Implementation (Easiest First)

  Phase 1: Fix the Close Logic

  // In JobManager.mqh - UpdateJobs()
  if (ShouldSpawnNew(newest_idx)) {
      // DON'T close if losing!
      if (m_jobs[newest_idx].unrealized_pnl > 0) {
          // Profitable grid full = close and spawn
          StopJob(old_job_id, "Grid full - PROFIT");
          SpawnJob();
      } else {
          // Losing grid full = keep running, spawn rescue job
          m_jobs[newest_idx].status = JOB_FULL; // Mark full but 
  active
          SpawnRescueJob(newest_idx); // Spawn helper job
      }
  }

  Phase 2: Add Profit Targets

  // New input parameters
  input double InpJobTPUSD = 10.0;  // Take profit per job
  input double InpJobTrailStart = 5.0; // Start trailing at $5

  // In UpdateJobs()
  if (job.unrealized_pnl >= InpJobTPUSD) {
      StopJob(job.job_id, "JOB TP HIT");
  }

  Phase 3: Range Detection

  // Detect sideways market
  bool IsRanging() {
      double atr = GetATR();
      double price_range = High[1] - Low[1];
      return (price_range < atr * 0.5); // Tight range
  }

  // Adjust strategy
  if (IsRanging()) {
      m_params.grid_spacing *= 0.7; // Tighter grid
      m_params.target_cycle_usd = 2.0; // Quick profits
  }

  🎯 Quick Win Settings to Test

  Try these parameter adjustments first:

  // Aggressive profit mode
  InpGridLevels = 10          // More levels before "full"
  InpTargetCycleUSD = 2.0     // Smaller, quicker profits
  InpJobSL_USD = 30.0         // Tighter SL
  InpSpawnCooldownSec = 10    // Faster spawning

  // Add new params
  InpCloseOnlyProfit = true   // Don't close losing jobs
  InpMinProfitToClose = 1.0   // Min $1 profit to close
  InpRangeMode = true         // Enable range detection

  📈 Expected Results

  With these changes:
  - Win Rate: Stay high (80%+)
  - Average Win: Increase to $15-20
  - Average Loss: Reduce to $20-30
  - Profit Factor: Target 1.5+
  - Recovery Factor: Target 2.0+

  The key insight: Your system wins 83% of the time but loses big
   on the 17%. We need to either:
  1. Make wins bigger (profit acceleration)
  2. Make losses smaller (tighter SL)
  3. Avoid closing at worst time (smart close logic)

  Which approach appeals to you most? I recommend starting with
  fixing the close logic since that's the biggest issue I see.
