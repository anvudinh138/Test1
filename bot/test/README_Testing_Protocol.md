## 📊 **Required Results Format**

### **For Each Test, Please Provide:**

#### **1. Summary Statistics:**
```
Test: PTG_Test_01_Quality_Over_Quantity
Period: 1 Month (XAUUSD M1)
Total Signals: ???
Total Trades: ???
Signal Efficiency: ??? (signals/trades ratio)
Win Rate: ???%
Profit Factor: ???
Maximum Drawdown: ???%
Net Profit: $???
```

#### **2. Performance Breakdown:**
```
Winning Trades: ??? (avg profit: ??? pips)
Losing Trades: ??? (avg loss: ??? pips)
Largest Win: ??? pips
Largest Loss: ??? pips
Average Trade: ??? pips
```

#### **3. Log Files Needed:**
- ✅ **Full debug log** (like result-1.txt)

## 🔥 **Specific Testing Instructions**

### **Test #1: Quality Over Quantity**
```
Settings:
- PushRangePercent = 0.80 (vs 0.35 baseline)
- ClosePercent = 0.80 (vs 0.45 baseline)  
- VolHighMultiplier = 2.0 (vs 1.0 baseline)
- TPMultiplier = 2.5 (vs 1.5 baseline)

Expected: Dramatic reduction in signals, much higher win rate
Question: Can we achieve <500 signals with >80% win rate?
```

### **Test #2: Volume Confirmation**
```
Settings:
- Advanced volume spike detection
- Volume > 2x average of last 20 bars
- Volume increase > 150% from previous bar
- Combined with standard PTG logic

Expected: Better signal quality through volume analysis
Question: Does real volume analysis improve performance?
```

### **Test #3: Market Structure**
```
Settings:
- Session filtering (London/NY only)
- ATR-based volatility filter
- Minimum 50-pip range requirement
- Simple S/R level awareness

Expected: Fewer but much higher quality trades
Question: Does market context improve win rate significantly?
```

### **Test #4: Multi-Timeframe**
```
Settings:
- M5 PTG confirmation required
- M15 trend alignment required
- M1 for precise entry timing
- Highest selectivity

Expected: Ultra-high quality signals, very few trades
Question: Can multi-TF achieve >90% win rate?
```

## 📈 **Comparative Analysis Framework**

### **Compare Against Baseline (Original v1.0.0):**
```
Baseline Performance:
- Signals: 6,954/day
- Trades: 319/day  
- Efficiency: 21.8 signals per trade
- Win Rate: ~60% (estimated)

Target Improvements:
- 90% reduction in signals
- 50% improvement in win rate
- 3x better signal efficiency
- Consistent profitability
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ **Signal Efficiency**: <10 signals per trade (vs 21.8 baseline)
- ✅ **Win Rate**: >70% minimum (vs ~60% baseline)
- ✅ **Profit Factor**: >2.0 (risk-adjusted returns)
- ✅ **Drawdown**: <10% maximum
- ✅ **Consistency**: Profitable across all test periods

---

## 🚨 **Failure Criteria (IMMEDIATE REJECTION)**
- Signal spam ratio still >15 signals per trade
- Win rate <65% 
- Maximum drawdown >15%
- Negative profit factor
- No improvement over baseline
