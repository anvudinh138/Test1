# FlexGridDCA EA Configuration for EURUSD
# Copy these settings to MT5 Expert Advisor inputs

=== BASIC SETTINGS ===
InpFixedLotSize = 0.01          # Safe for high margin accounts
InpMaxGridLevels = 5            # Conservative start with 5 levels
InpATRMultiplier = 1.0          # Standard ATR spacing
InpEnableGridTrading = true     # Enable grid system
InpEnableDCATrading = true      # Enable DCA averaging

=== RISK MANAGEMENT ===
InpMaxAccountRisk = 10.0        # Maximum 10% account risk
InpProfitTargetPercent = 1.0    # 1% profit target
InpProfitTargetUSD = 3.0        # $3 USD profit target
InpUseTotalProfitTarget = true  # Use TOTAL profit (both directions combined)  
InpMaxSpreadPips = 8.0          # Max 8 pips spread (more realistic for EURUSD)
InpUseVolatilityFilter = false  # Disable volatility filter initially

=== TIME FILTERS ===
InpUseTimeFilter = false        # Disable for 24/7 trading
InpStartHour = 8                # London open
InpEndHour = 18                 # NY close

=== ADVANCED ===
InpEnableTrailingStop = false   # Disable initially for simplicity
InpTrailingStopATR = 2.0        # 2x ATR trailing if enabled
InpMagicNumber = 12345          # Unique identifier
InpEAComment = "FlexGridDCA"    # Position comment

# RECOMMENDED SETTINGS FOR EURUSD:
# - Start with demo account
# - Use 0.01 lot size (always fixed)
# - $5 USD target = easy to achieve with 0.01 lots
# - 1% of $500 account = $5, so both targets aligned
# - Monitor profit taking frequency (should see resets)
# - ATR H1 typically 50-150 pips for EURUSD

# SAFETY NOTES:
# - Fixed 0.01 lot size prevents account explosion
# - Maximum 5 levels = max 0.05 lots per direction
# - $5 USD target is achievable and frequent
# - Lower target = more frequent profit cycles
# - Each direction operates independently
